# Algorithm ideas: 
- 3D Map?
   - jogging in a hilly area
   - cost of energy or fuel 
- Blocked area 2D map?
- robotic movement with goals/tasks?

- indiana jones styled time limited, object avoidence map?
- trash collection, several pick ups, start far or close?
- taxi round trips, multiple locations to meet through several paths
- route to work with three different routes (depending on the goals - fuel, speed)
- solving a maze
- bus route optimization (time, cost?)
- River crossing problem, can this be done through nodes, use of a lmg?

# Pitch
- Tic Tac Toe/Connect 4 using Minimax Algorithm
   - Comparing how AI reacts to players input.

- D* senarios (Focused D*, A*, D* lite)
   - Bus routes (start to goal, bus timetable)
      - e.g getting from Newcastle to Bath. multiple routes to get to the goal. find the cheapest and fastest possible route.
      - bus fares vary and change in real time.
      - depending on how much money is inputed. more expensive bus fare == quicker route.
      - Random bus cancellations in real time.

- Using minimax for rock paper scissors?
